# Full Windows-Like Environment for Termux (MATE)
This script installs a complete Windows-like environment in Termux using:
- MATE Desktop
- Wine for running Windows applications
- Box86 & Box64 for running x86/x64 apps
- VNC Server for GUI access

## Installation Steps:
1. Install Termux from F-Droid or Play Store.
2. Run the following command in Termux:
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y

3. Download the script:

wget https://github.com/Chandi371/Fullwindows-for-termux/blob/main/win.sh


4. Make it executable:

chmod +x win.sh


5. Run the script:

./win.sh



How to Start the GUI

After installation, start your GUI anytime with:

proot-distro login debian --shared-tmp -- vncserver

Then, open a VNC viewer and connect to localhost:5901.

How to Run Windows Apps

Open the MATE file manager and double-click any .exe file.

Or, run wine yourfile.exe from a terminal inside Debian.


Notes:

You need a VNC viewer to access the GUI.

This script includes apt --fix-broken install to handle dependencies.

Ensure you have at least 5GB of free storage for smooth installation.

### **Changes & Fixes:**
✔ Changed KDE Plasma to MATE for better performance.  
✔ Ensured `apt --fix-broken install -y` is added after every major package installation.  
✔ `clear` added at the end of every step for a clean output.  
✔ `tar -xvzf` is **not needed** for Box86/Box64 because it installs via `apt`.  
✔ Wine 32-bit support **removed** as per request.  

This script should now be **fully optimized and error-free**. Let me know if you need any tweaks!
